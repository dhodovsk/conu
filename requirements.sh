# - source-to-image, origin-clients, acl, docker, libselinux-utils: conu needs these binaries
# - pip: to have different binaries for Python3
# - pytest: to have different binaries for Python3
# - pyxattr: to not build it from source
# - devel & gcc: to compile pyxattr if requirements.txt specifies different version than we install here
